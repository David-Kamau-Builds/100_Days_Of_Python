# Day 12 - Number Guessing Game

## Overview
Day 12 of the 100 Days of Python challenge features a command-line Number Guessing Game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

## Number Guessing Game Features
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Offers two difficulty levels: 'easy' (10 attempts) and 'hard' (5 attempts).
- Provides feedback on each guess ('too high', 'too low', or correct).
- Tracks the number of remaining attempts.
- Determines if the player wins or loses based on attempts remaining.
- Integrates ASCII art for a better user experience.

## Key Concepts
- **Functions with Outputs**: Using `return` to pass values between functions.
- **Function Parameters**: Passing multiple arguments to functions to calculate game state.
- **Conditional Logic**: Extensive use of `if/elif/else` to evaluate guesses and difficulty levels.
- **Loops**: `while` loops to manage the main game flow and repeated guessing.
- **Random Numbers**: Using the `random` module to generate unpredictable game challenges.

## Tasks
- [x] Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
- [x] Implement a function to validate and check the player's guess.
- [x] Create a function to set the difficulty level.
- [x] Provide appropriate feedback for each guess (too high/too low).
- [x] Track the number of remaining attempts.
- [x] Handle win and loss conditions.
- [x] Allow the game to be replayed.
- [x] Display ASCII art logo at the start of the game.
