# Day 3 - Conditional Logic Projects

## Overview
Day 3 of the 100 Days of Python challenge - two projects demonstrating if/elif/else statements and nested conditionals.

## Project 1: Pizza Order System
Pizza ordering system with size selection, toppings, and pricing calculations.

## Project 2: Treasure Hunt Adventure Game
Text-based adventure game with multiple choice paths and win/lose conditions.

## Tasks
- [x] Create pizza ordering system with size selection
- [x] Add pepperoni and cheese toppings with pricing
- [x] Handle different pizza sizes (S, M, L)
- [x] Create adventure game with multiple choice paths
- [x] Implement nested conditional logic
- [x] Add win/lose conditions based on choices

## Notes
Both projects focus on conditional statements (if/elif/else) and user input validation. The pizza system demonstrates nested conditionals for pricing logic, while the treasure hunt shows branching storylines based on player choices.
