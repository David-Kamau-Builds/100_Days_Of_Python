# Day 10 - Calculator

## Overview
Day 10 of the 100 Days of Python challenge - a functional calculator using functions as first-class objects and dictionaries.

## Calculator Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Continuous calculations using previous results
- Function storage in dictionaries
- Interactive operation selection
- ASCII art logo integration

## Key Concepts
- **Functions as First-Class Objects**: Storing functions in variables and dictionaries
- **Dictionary of Functions**: Using dictionaries to map symbols to functions
- **Function References**: Calling functions through dictionary lookups
- **Continuous Operations**: Chaining calculations together
- **User Interface**: Interactive calculator experience

## Tasks
- [x] Define arithmetic operation functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- [x] Create operations dictionary mapping symbols to functions
- [x] Get user input for numbers and operations
- [x] Display available operations to user
- [x] Execute selected operation using dictionary lookup
- [x] Display calculation results
- [x] Implement continuous calculation feature
- [x] Handle operation chaining with previous results

## Notes
Demonstrates functions as first-class objects in Python, showing how functions can be stored in data structures and called dynamically. Introduces the concept of using dictionaries for function dispatch patterns.
