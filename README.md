# 100 Days of Python Challenge - Week 3 Summary

## Overview
Week 3 of the 100 Days of Python challenge transitions from procedural to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This week focuses on building more complex applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), managing state, and handling user events, culminating in the creation of two classic games.

## Projects Completed

### Day 15 - Coffee Machine Simulator
- **Concept**: Data Structures and Modular Functions
- **Project**: A simulator for a coin-operated coffee machine that manages resources and processes transactions.
- **Skills**: Dictionaries for data management, function modularity, global variable scope, and `while` loops.

### Day 16 - Coffee Machine in OOP
- **Concept**: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Project**: Refactored the Coffee Machine from Day 15 using classes and objects (`CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`).
- **Skills**: Class creation, object attributes and methods, and structuring code into logical, reusable components.

### Day 17 - The Quiz Project
- **Concept**: OOP and Modular Design
- **Project**: A quiz game built with multiple classes (`Question`, `QuizBrain`) to manage data and logic separately.
- **Skills**: OOP principles, transforming data into objects, and managing program flow with a `while` loop.

### Day 18 - Turtle & GUI Programming
- **Concept**: Turtle Graphics, GUI, and External Libraries
- **Project**: A replica of a Damien Hirst "spot painting" using the `turtle` module to draw on a GUI canvas.
- **Skills**: Using the `turtle` module, managing a GUI, installing external libraries (`colorgram`), and working with RGB colors.

### Day 19 - Turtle Race & Event Listeners
- **Concept**: State Management, Multiple Instances, and Higher-Order Functions
- **Project**: An interactive turtle racing game where the user bets on a winner.
- **Skills**: Managing program state, creating multiple object instances, and using event listeners (`screen.ontimer()`).

### Day 20 - Building the Snake Game (Part 1)
- **Concept**: OOP Design, Animation Control, and Event Handling
- **Project**: The first part of the classic Snake game, focusing on the snake's body and movement.
- **Skills**: OOP class design, smooth animation with `screen.tracer(0)`, and handling user input with `screen.onkey()`.

### Day 21 - Building the Snake Game (Part 2)
- **Concept**: Class Inheritance and Collision Detection
- **Project**: Completed the Snake game by adding food, a scoreboard, and collision detection logic.
- **Skills**: Using class inheritance, detecting collisions between game objects, and using list slicing.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, attributes, methods, and inheritance).
- Structuring complex applications by separating data and logic into different classes.
- Building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with the `turtle` module.
- Managing animation and program state for interactive applications.
- Handling user input through event listeners for real-time control.
- Practical application of data structures like lists and dictionaries within an OOP context.
- Using external Python libraries to extend program functionality.
- Advanced list manipulation with slicing.

## Progress

**Week 3 Completed**: Days 15-21 completed with 7 projects focused on OOP, GUI applications, and game development.
