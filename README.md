# 100 Days of Python Challenge - Week 8 Summary

## Overview
Week 8 of the 100 Days of Python challenge continues with advanced web automation, browser scripting, and interactive web applications. This week features intelligent browser bots for dating and social media platforms, automated testing tools, decorator patterns, and full-stack Flask web applications for games and meme sharing.

## Projects Completed

### Day 50 - Tinder Bot Automation
- **Concept**: Intelligent browser automation using Selenium to streamline the process of liking profiles on dating applications.
- **Project**: Automated Tinder bot with Facebook authentication, modal window handling, and continuous profile liking with error recovery.
- **Skills**: Selenium WebDriver, window switching, XPath and CSS selectors, exception handling, modal dialog management, and secure credential management with environment variables.

### Day 51 - Internet Speed Twitter Bot
- **Concept**: Automated bot that measures internet connection speed and posts complaints to Twitter if speeds fall below promised levels.
- **Project**: Bot that tests internet speed on speedtest.net, extracts results, and tweets to internet provider with conditional messaging based on speed thresholds.
- **Skills**: Selenium automation, multi-site navigation, text data extraction, form submission, Twitter integration, dynamic content composition, and timing management.

### Day 52 - Instagram Follower Bot
- **Concept**: Automated Instagram bot that targets followers of a specified account and automatically follows them with human-like behavior patterns.
- **Project**: Selenium bot that logs into Instagram, navigates to a target account's followers, scrolls through the list, and automatically follows users with randomized delays.
- **Skills**: WebDriverWait with explicit conditions, JavaScript execution, click interception handling, stealth browser options, human behavior simulation, and modal dialog detection.

### Day 53 - Zillow Property Scraper & Google Forms Submission Bot
- **Concept**: Automated web scraper and form submission bot that extracts property listings and submits data to Google Forms for data collection.
- **Project**: Scrapes property listings from a Zillow clone, extracts address/price/links, and automatically fills out multi-page Google Forms with collected data.
- **Skills**: Dynamic element waiting, CSS selectors with data-test attributes, form interaction, element scrolling to view, visible element filtering, and multi-step automation workflows.

### Day 54 - Decorators - Function Speed Calculation
- **Concept**: Python decorators that add functionality to existing functions without modifying their code, specifically measuring execution time.
- **Project**: Custom speed calculator decorator applied to multiple functions to track and report their performance with timing measurements.
- **Skills**: Decorator creation and application, function wrapping with nested functions, args and kwargs handling, time measurement with `time.time()`, and performance profiling.

### Day 55 - Flask Number Guessing Game
- **Concept**: Interactive web-based game built with Flask using route handling, random number generation, and dynamic HTML responses.
- **Project**: Flask application with multiple routes for game logic, providing visual feedback via animated GIFs for each game state.
- **Skills**: Flask framework setup, route decorators with variable URL segments, random module usage, HTML string rendering, conditional logic, and Flask development server configuration.

### Day 56 - Meme Website with Flask
- **Concept**: Multi-page web application built with Flask featuring template rendering, static file serving, and dynamic content generation.
- **Project**: Flask application with Jinja2 templates for displaying meme collections, individual meme pages, and forms for adding new memes.
- **Skills**: Flask multi-page routing, Jinja2 template syntax, static file management, `url_for()` for dynamic URLs, template inheritance, and GET/POST request handling.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **Advanced Selenium Automation**: Mastered browser automation for social media and web applications with sophisticated element interaction, waits, and error handling.
- **Multi-Site Bot Development**: Created bots that automate workflows across multiple websites (Tinder, Twitter, Instagram, Zillow, Google Forms).
- **Element Interaction Strategies**: Handled click interception, modal dialogs, dynamic elements, and JavaScript-heavy interfaces with multiple wait strategies.
- **Human-Like Bot Behavior**: Implemented randomized delays, stealth options, and natural interaction patterns to avoid detection by anti-bot systems.
- **Python Decorators**: Understood and applied decorator patterns for function enhancement without modifying original code.
- **Flask Web Development**: Built dynamic web applications with routing, template rendering, static file management, and multi-page navigation.
- **Form Handling and Data Submission**: Automated form filling, element visibility checking, and multi-step form workflows across different platforms.
- **Security and Credential Management**: Securely managed sensitive credentials with environment variables throughout automation workflows.

## Progress

**Week 8 Completed**: Days 50-56 completed with 7 projects focused on CSS, web scraping, browser automation, and interactive web tools.
