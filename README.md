# 100 Days of Python Challenge - Week 2 Summary

## Overview
Week 2 of the 100 Days of Python challenge, building on fundamental concepts to explore advanced function concepts, data structures, and game development patterns.

## Projects Completed

### Day 8 - Caesar Cipher
- **Concept**: Function parameters and arguments
- **Project**: Encoder/decoder with custom shift amounts
- **Skills**: String manipulation, modulo operations, module imports, function parameters

### Day 9 - Secret Auction Program
- **Concept**: Dictionaries and error handling
- **Project**: Secret auction bidding platform with input validation
- **Skills**: Dictionary methods, try/except blocks, OS module, cross-platform compatibility, data structures

### Day 10 - Calculator
- **Concept**: Functions as first-class objects
- **Project**: Interactive calculator with continuous operations
- **Skills**: Function storage in dictionaries, function references, chaining calculations, design patterns

### Day 11 - Blackjack Game
- **Concept**: Functions with outputs and game state management
- **Project**: Command-line Blackjack (21) game
- **Skills**: Return values, list manipulation, conditional logic, loops, complex game rules

### Day 12 - Number Guessing Game
- **Concept**: Functions with outputs, difficulty settings, and game loops
- **Project**: Command-line Number Guessing Game (guess a random number between 1 and 100)
- **Skills**: Random number generation, `while` loops, function parameters and return values, conditional logic, user input validation

### Day 13 - Debugging Exercise
- **Concept**: Debugging, function scope, and list manipulation
- **Project**: Small debugging task — fix a `mutate` function that transforms a list by doubling items, adding a random integer, and using a helper `maths` module
- **Skills**: Debugging techniques, loops and list operations, using helper modules, `random.randint`, practicing with debugger tools (breakpoints, Step Into/Step Over)

### Day 14 - Higher or Lower Game
- **Concept**: Functions with default parameters, game loops, and data structures
- **Project**: Higher or Lower guessing game where players compare two famous people and guess who has more Instagram followers
- **Skills**: Functions with default parameters, module imports, game state management, string formatting with f-strings, conditional logic, random selection

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Advanced function concepts (parameters, return values, default arguments, functions as objects)
- Dictionaries as core data structures and for function dispatch patterns
- Error handling with try/except blocks
- Game development patterns and game state management
- String manipulation and formatting
- Module organization and imports
- Debugging and code inspection techniques
- Building more complex interactive applications

## Progress

**Week 2 Completed**: Days 8-14 completed with 7 projects covering functions, game development, and debugging
