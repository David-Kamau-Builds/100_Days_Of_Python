- **Skills**: Amadeus API for flight data and OAuth2 authentication, Google Sheets integration via Sheety API for destination management, multi-channel notifications (SMS/WhatsApp) via Twilio, automated price monitoring with configurable thresholds, IATA code lookup and validation, and modular architecture design for scalable systems.

### Day 40 - Capstone Part 2 - Flight Club
- **Concept**: Customer Management, Email Automation, and Enhanced Notification Systems. Extending the flight finder into a complete customer service platform with multiple communication channels.
- **Project**: Enhanced flight deal finder with email notification capabilities for multiple customers, creating a complete flight club notification system with customer database management and multi-channel alerts.
- **Skills**: Customer database management via Google Sheets with user preferences, bulk email processing with SMTP for newsletter-style notifications, multi-channel notifications (Email + WhatsApp) for comprehensive coverage, enhanced error handling for production reliability, USD currency standardization for consistent pricing, and scalable notification architecture for multiple users.

### Day 41 - Introduction to HTML
- **Concept**: Web Foundations and HTML5 Document Structure. Transitioning from Python automation to web development fundamentals, learning the building blocks of web pages.
- **Project**: Personal movie recommendation webpage with semantic HTML structure and accessibility features, demonstrating proper web document organization.
- **Skills**: HTML5 semantic elements (header, main, section, footer) for meaningful structure, document structure and organization with proper nesting, text content markup with headings and paragraphs, meta tags for responsive design and SEO, and web accessibility principles for inclusive design.

### Day 42 - HTML Intermediate - Forms and Structure
- **Concept**: Enhanced HTML Structure, Security Best Practices, and User Experience Design. Building on HTML fundamentals to create more interactive and secure web content.
